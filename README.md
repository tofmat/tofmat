ðŸ‘‹ Holla! I'm Tosin Ogunfowote

I am a frontend engineer based in Nigeria with an eye for a number of things. I'm most passionate about building amazing things with nice aesthetics, and most importantly *available to every one on the web.

I play with Vue.Js, touch React sometimes and love dipping my feets in super cool Javascript frameworks and CSS tricks. I'm also a big advocate for WordPress as I've been building stuffs with WordPress since forever (also giving back to the WordPress community as much as I can). I organized the WordCamp Ife Conference in 2019 and looking to do more for the community in coming years.

When I'm not doing anything tech, I am admiring amazing interior designs and hoping I have the opportunity to go into it soon. I also love photography and play to be a photographer with my smart phone sometimes. 

  ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on easing the stress university students pass through in getting accommodations through SeekHostel.
  ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m usually learning anything that catches my eye/attention.
  ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on cool projects.
  ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Vue.Js, WordPress, CSS

  âš¡ Fun fact: I never owned any video game. I could be on the internet the whole day. And yeah I love travelling and trying out new things.
