**ðŸ‘‹ Holla! I'm Tosin Ogunfowote**

I am a frontend engineer based in Nigeria with an eye for a number of things. I'm most passionate about building amazing solutions that works, and most importantly *available to every one on the web.

I play with Javascript and Typescript using ReactJS and Vue.Js. I love dipping my feets in super cool Javascript frameworks and CSS tricks. I have more than 4 years of experience coding professionally. I'm also a big advocate for WordPress and the no code community.
